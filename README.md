# housingpricemodel
This code reads in a CSV file containing housing data and trains a linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on the other features in the dataset. The code prompts the user to enter values for each feature and uses the trained model to predict the price based on the user input. The predicted price is then printed to the console.
